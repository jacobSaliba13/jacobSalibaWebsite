                        Seeking Gesamtkunstwerk is my dissertation project, this project aims to answer and research two
                        question, how to create
                        an effective Audio -Visual performance through software? And what elements create immersion in
                        an AV performance? To
                        answer both of these questions I researched upon the principles of perception, immersion and the
                        relationship between
                        sound and visual. The research conclude that four main elements are the bases of any successful
                        AV performance these
                        are: Physical, Social Knowledge, Composing and Perception each category owns its very own sub
                        categories which further
                        explain the reasoning behind each category and why all of them are important as to create the
                        concept of synchresis.

                    The research started by identifying what kind of software to use and why would one try to create
                    customizable software
                    when there are commercial VJ software which can be used. The video above shows some of the first
                    tests done with Touch
                    Designer. The notion of creating your own software was finally making sense to me the ability to
                    create specific
                    generative art which works exactly how you want it made the process fun and a new world was being
                    presented to me.

            <div class="wrapper">
                <div class="col-md-12 p-4  d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center">
                    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAhPLaHqp7Q&t=262s" target="_blank">

            <div class=" col-12  d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center ">

                <p>
                    The next step of the process was that to put my practice in a real live scenario. I created a VJ
                    software which was made
                    totally out of a procedural network for both the visual elements and the UI. This program was tested
                    in a party where I
                    video jocked for around 5 hours. The testing was priceless I could notice certain elements which
                    were never thought off.
                    This part motivated me further as to further my research and creat a software from which the
                    musician could play both
                    his music and visual all in real time.

                        The three clips above show the final software in work. Ableton and Touch designer were linked
                        and data from the master
                        program being Ableton was transferred to touch designer were all the visuals could be triggered
                        and manipulated from
                        such data automatically.

                        The final step of the processes was that of building an environment as for this project to be
                        showcased in. The three
                        renders above show the layout of the box which was built as to create the concept of immersion.
                        The Box includes a short
                        throw projector and a 360 speaker. The angle and distance of the screen was calculated as to
                        create a 60-degree angle
                        which is the humans average focal length angle. The box aims at disconnected people from their
                        surroundings whilst
                        immersing them in the audio-visual performance.
